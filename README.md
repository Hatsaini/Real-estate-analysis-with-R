# R Projects Repository

This repository contains two projects showcasing statistical analysis conducted in R Markdown. Both projects demonstrate skills in data exploration, modeling, and visualization.

## Projects

### 1. **Real Estate Analysis**
- **Objective:** Analyze property price data to identify key predictors and build predictive models.
- **Key Tasks:**
  - Explored relationships between predictors (size, bedrooms, age) and price.
  - Built and validated regression models to predict property prices.
  - Used feature selection techniques to refine the model.
- **Highlights:**
  - Identified size as the strongest predictor of property price.
  - Achieved a final model with improved efficiency using adjusted RÂ².

### 2. **Goods Freshness Analysis**
- **Objective:** Investigate how packaging and storage affect the freshness of goods.
- **Key Tasks:**
  - Conducted ANOVA to evaluate the impact of storage and packaging.
  - Built interaction models to study their combined effects.
  - Validated the final model using residual analysis.
- **Highlights:**
  - Found that both storage and packaging significantly influence freshness.
  - Interaction between storage and packaging was statistically insignificant.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Language:** R
- **Libraries:** `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `knitr`
- **Outputs:** Statistical insights, regression models, and clear visualizations.
